	1.	Description
_______________________________________________________________________________

OpenGC is part of the groundstation software for the Albatross UAV project.
OpenGC was originally authored by Damion Shelton for use by flight simulator
enthusiasts in 2001-2004, and subsequently has been modified and improved to
suit realtime monitoring of aircraft, such as autonomous aircraft (remotely from
the ground), or perhaps for use in the cockpit of piloted aircraft. 

To get an idea for what does not yet work, or work correctly, see the TODO file.
